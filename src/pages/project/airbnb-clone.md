<!-- This checkout page was made and designed for Precision Reloading with the intentions to bring them to a more modern stack. This single page application is built with Nuxt.js and Express on an IBM iSeries. The backend was integrated with their existing business suite written with RPG. This was very challenging due to the difficulty of working with the IBM iSeries as a web developer. I did all the dev-ops to get this running live, as well as designed the frontend and backend architecture.
