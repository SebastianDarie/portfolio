This react app was made and designed to replicate Twitter's core functionality. This single page app
is built with <span class="react">React(CRA)</span> and <span class="firebase">Firebase</span>.
Firebase is used as a BaaS which provides all of the CRUD functionality, the data is then stored in Redux.
For styling it uses Styled-Components. It implements the suggested code-splitting methods by React like React.lazy and Suspense.
Some of its core features are user profiles, tweets, hearts, retweets, comments, following, search functionality both for users and tweets.
